# TODO.md File Structure and Format Rules

## File Structure
- Use phases to group related TODO tasks (e.g., "Phase 1: Project Initialization & Structure")
- Phases should be ordered logically and numbered sequentially
- Each phase contains related TODO tasks
- New phases should be added at the bottom of the file

## TODO Task Format
```
TODO: [Task Title] <!-- id: task-[number] -->
**Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] [Criteria 1]
- [ ] [Criteria 2]
- [x] [Completed criteria]
```

## Task ID Rules
- **NEVER** change existing `<!-- id: task-[number] -->` comments
- New tasks must get the next sequential number
- Task IDs are immutable once created
- Use format: `<!-- id: task-001 -->`, `<!-- id: task-002 -->`, etc.

## Task Modification Rules
- **TODO title is CONSTANT** - never change the task title after creation
- Only the "Acceptance Criteria" section can be modified
- Checkboxes can be updated to reflect completion status
- Criteria items can be added, removed, or modified as needed

## New Task Addition
- New tasks must be added at the bottom of the file
- Assign the next sequential task ID
- Follow the exact format shown above
- Group under appropriate phase or create new phase if needed

## File Organization
- Keep phases in logical order
- Maintain consistent markdown formatting
- Use checkboxes for tracking completion
- Preserve all existing task IDs and titles
